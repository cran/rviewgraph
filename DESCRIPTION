Description: This is an 'R' interface to Alun Thomas's 'ViewGraph' 'Java' graph
    viewing program.
    It takes a graph specified as an incidence matrix, list of
    edges, or in 'igraph' format and runs a graphical user interface that shows
    an animation of a force directed algorithm positioning the vertices in two
    dimensions. It works well for graphs of various structure of up to a few
    thousand vertices. It's not fazed by graphs that comprise several
    components. The coordinates can be read as an 'igraph' style layout 
    matrix at any time. The user can mess with the layout using a mouse, 
    preferably one with 3 buttons, and some keyed commands.
